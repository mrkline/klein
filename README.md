# Klein

My clumsy foray into fonts.

## Goals:

The project aims to create a serif font heavily inspired by Caslon and Bookman,
with a bit less contrast and fewer fine curves to make the glyphs more readable
at low resolutions or on my crappy injket.

[LibreCaslon](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Caslon-Text)
was used as the base of this project, with changes and tweaks made throughout.
(Many thanks to its authors, Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida!)
Inspiration and some glyphs were also borrowed from
[TeX Gyre](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/) Bonum.
